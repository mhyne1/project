#### Description: My CS50 Final Project is called “Asteroid Field”. it’s a game coded in lua using Love2D. It’s a basic space shooter. Firstly, there is a menu where the player can begin a game and quit. Then, I can load the game. There are asteroids and big ships that appear are civil transport lost in space. The player has to not destroy them. The player must destroy asteroids and not kill civil transports otherwise, he will die. The score increases when the player destroys asteroids. And when i die, a game over screen appear for 3 seconds then i can reload. For the code, there is a main.lua that handles the majority of the code, including player movement, enemy behavior, object collisions, and many other things. Additionally, there is a button.lua file that defines the characteristics of buttons, and a menu.lua file for displaying the buttons and the menu. Finally, there is a text.lua file that defines the characteristics of the text displayed on the screen. So this was my cs50 project and i hope that you will enjoy.
